## getting basic resources

making it without ideal leather gloves could hurt player with 40% chance. with each glove hole +15% chance.

gloves have ~1% chance of making hole. if hole was made 10% bleeding chance or 40% scratch.

3% decrease chance of injure per carpentry lvl

- tin can + bottle **OR** 5 x reading glasses **OR** 2 x vine glass + hammer(k) **=>** tin can with glass shards
- 4 x tin cans + glass shards(from window) => 4 x tin cans with glass shards
- tin can with glass shards + sledgehammer => tin can with glass sand

## melting glass

no gloves 30% chance of getting injuring hands (+15% for each hole)

no mask 15% chance of injuring head

3% decrease chance per metalworking lvl

**requires recipe**

- tin can with glass sand + 0.4 blow torch + 0.5 glue + 0.5 adhesive tape => quick glass fix kit

## mechanics

additional 0.5 per mechanics level

**requires recipe**

quick glass fix kit + broken glass => random 1-3 quality increase

quick glass fix kit (hot) + broken glass => random 2-5 quality increase

**mechanics x 4**

hunting knife + tyre => tire shards (amount depends on mechanics and tyre condition, but 2 shards min)

blowtorch + tyre shard => 1-5% tyre fix (depends on mechanics)

**electricity x 7 + metalworking x 7 + mechanics x 7**

electronic scrap x 10 + wires x 10 + scrap metal x 3 + metal pipes x 2 + metal sheet x 1 => 5-15 engine parts

**electricity x 8 + metalworking x 8 + mechanics x 8**

electronic scrap x 20 + wires x 20 + scrap metal x 5 + metal pipes x 5 + metal sheet x 5 => engine tuning kit

engine + engine tuning kit + wrench + blowtorch + screwdriver => +1-5% engine quality (60% max)

**fine engine tuning kit** low chance drop or in a car shop

engine + fine engine tuning kit + wrench + blowtorch + screwdriver => +1-5% engine quality (80% max)
 

## *later*

shovel \ trowel + bucket + sand + near river (tile water source) => 20% chance of 0.1 clay in a bucket

30 rocks + 2 x bucket of concrete + 3 x bucket of clay => kiln for glass working

2 x bucket of clay + 4 x metal pipes (k) + 2 metal sheets (k) => wet glass form

wet glass form in kiln for glass working => 50% chance of getting clay glass form \ 50% of crumble form

4x crumbled form + wet glass form in kiln for glass working => 100% chance of getting clay glass form

glass form + 20 tins of glass sand + kiln => 70% of getting glass panel

- each metalworking lvl +3% chance

glass panel + knife\scalpel => auto front\back windshield

- quality depends on mechanics and metalworking

glass panel + knife\scalpel => auto side window + glass shards

glass panel + 4 planks => window (requires carpentry 7)

chance of getting glass fix depends on season and temperature even more

nerf 0.5 quick glass kit fix to 0.2 to promote making new glass instead

## *much later*

carpentry 3 + planks + rubber bands => resin farming kit

resin farming kit + tree => tree with farming kit

farming resin should work only during summer

resin drying rack => resin plate

resin plate + knife => resin shards

resin shards + blowtorch => fixing tyres
